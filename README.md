# ðŸŒ¤ Weather Dashboard 

The **Weather Dashboard** is a modern and responsive web application built using **React.js**. It allows users to search for real-time weather information of any city around the world. By integrating the **WeatherStack API**, the app fetches current weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The app is designed with a clean, minimalist user interface using **CSS** and features the **Glassmorphism effect**, which gives it a soft, blurred background for a sleek, professional look.

The appâ€™s primary goal is to provide an intuitive and engaging user experience. It not only presents weather information but also provides visual appeal through smooth transitions and animations. Whether you're looking for current weather conditions, humidity levels, or wind speed, the dashboard is equipped to provide all the necessary information in a visually accessible format. The real-time data is fetched from the **WeatherStack API**, ensuring that the information provided is up-to-date and accurate. The app is fully responsive, which means it works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

The key features of the Weather Dashboard include the ability to search for a city and instantly retrieve the weather information. Users can input any city name, and the app will display weather details such as:

- **Temperature** (in Celsius)
- **Weather Description** (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)
- **Humidity** (percentage)
- **Wind Speed** (in kilometers per hour)
- **Weather Icons** representing the current weather conditions

The application also provides meaningful feedback to users. For example, if a user inputs an invalid city name, the app will display an error message explaining that the city could not be found or if there is a problem with fetching the weather data. This ensures a smooth and friendly user experience even when something goes wrong.

The user interface is styled with **CSS3** and incorporates the **Glassmorphism** design trend, which features frosted glass-like elements with a blur effect. This modern design helps the app stand out visually while maintaining a clean and minimalistic appearance. The fade-in animations and smooth transitions further enhance the user experience, making the application more dynamic and engaging.
